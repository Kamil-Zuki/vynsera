It’s 12 books long, has lots of repetition and fairly short sentences. However, be warned. The author is completely unable to write decent characters. The men fight, the women cry and scream and cook and protect the children. The women and children are so poorly developed as characters that most of the time you forget that they’re even there. Also, there are extremely long scenes where the only thing that happens is that the main character is frightened. For 20 pages at a time. At the start of the series it’s pretty good fun, but the flaws become unbearable by around book 3 or 4\\."

Based on the novel of the same title by Lee Cheong-jun, famous writer, Lee Joon-seop, returns to his hometown to attend his mother's funeral. Lee's illegitimate niece, who has been ostracized from the family, has also returned home for the funeral. While the funeral ceremonies take place, various old family conflicts reassert themselves. During the action of the story, a parallel children's story written by Lee is read by the illegitimate niece.
