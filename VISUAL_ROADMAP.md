# Visual Interactive Roadmap

## Overview

The Korean learning roadmap has been redesigned to be visual, interactive, and efficient - similar to roadmap.sh. Each step is now a clickable node that shows relevant resources and tracks your progress.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### 1. **Visual Flow Design**

- Flowchart-style nodes connected vertically
- Color-coded status (locked, available, completed)
- Visual progress indicators
- Clean, scannable layout

### 2. **Interactive Nodes**

- Click any unlocked step to view details
- See description, skills, and linked resources
- One-click progress tracking
- Prerequisite system (must complete earlier steps)

### 3. **Smart Resource Linking**

- Each step shows 3-5 curated resources
- Resources are pre-selected for that specific learning goal
- Click through directly to external links
- Mix of free and paid options

### 4. **Progress Tracking**

- Visual indicators on each node
- Progress bar showing overall completion
- Stats showing completed/total steps
- Percentage completion metric

### 5. **Sidebar Details Panel**

- Selected step details on the right
- Full list of skills to learn
- All recommended resources
- Mark complete button
- Time estimates

## üéØ How It Works

### Node States

**üîí Locked (Gray)**

- Prerequisites not met
- Cannot be started yet
- Shows lock icon
- Prevents wasting time on advanced topics

**‚≠ï Available (White/Outlined)**

- Ready to start
- Prerequisites completed
- Shows step number
- Click to view details

**‚úÖ Completed (Filled)**

- Marked as done
- Shows checkmark
- Can still view resources
- Unlocks next steps

### User Flow

```
1. Start with Step 1 (unlocked by default)
   ‚Üì
2. Click step to view resources
   ‚Üì
3. Study using linked resources
   ‚Üì
4. Mark step as complete
   ‚Üì
5. Next step unlocks automatically
   ‚Üì
6. Progress bar updates
   ‚Üì
7. Repeat until fluent! üéâ
```

## üìä Efficiency Features

### **No Time Wasted**

- Prerequisites prevent studying out of order
- Resources are pre-vetted for each step
- Clear time estimates
- Focused learning goals

### **Clear Learning Path**

- Linear progression (with branches later)
- Each step builds on previous
- Visual connections show flow
- Can't get lost or confused

### **Resource Integration**

- 3-5 resources per step (not overwhelming)
- Mix of videos, courses, tools
- Direct links to start learning
- Resources fetch from database in real-time

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation

### Components

**`VisualRoadmap.tsx`**

- Main roadmap visualization
- Node rendering and status logic
- Sidebar panel management
- Resource fetching

**`RoadmapPageClient.tsx`** (Redesigned)

- Enhanced header with stats
- Progress bar visualization
- Trophy/completion indicators
- Integrates VisualRoadmap component

### Data Structure

Each roadmap step includes:

```typescript
{
  id: string;              // Unique identifier
  title: string;           // Step name
  description: string;     // What you'll accomplish
  level: string;           // Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced
  order: number;           // Display order
  estimatedTime: string;   // "2-3 weeks"
  skills: string[];        // What you'll learn
  resources: string[];     // Resource IDs from database
  prerequisites: string[]; // Required previous steps
  completed: boolean;      // Progress tracking
}
```

### Resource Linking

Resources are linked by ID/slug:

1. Roadmap stores array of resource IDs
2. When step is selected, fetch matching resources from API
3. Display in sidebar with click-through links
4. Resources update dynamically from database

## üé® Visual Design

### Color Scheme

- **Locked**: Gray with reduced opacity
- **Available**: Primary border, white background
- **Completed**: Filled with primary color
- **Selected**: Bold border, shadow effect

### Layout

- **Mobile**: Stacked layout
- **Responsive**: Adapts to all screen sizes

### Interactions

- Hover effects on unlocked nodes
- Click to select/deselect
- Smooth transitions
- Accessibility support (ARIA roles, keyboard)

## üìö Resource Mappings

Each step is linked to specific resources:

### Beginner Steps

- **Hangul Mastery**: Ryan Estrada, Professor Yoon, Go Billy, Pink Fong, Korean ABC

## üí° Usage Tips

### For Beginners

1. Start with "Master Hangul" (always unlocked)
2. Complete each step fully before moving on
3. Use all recommended resources
4. Mark complete only when confident
5. Don't skip prerequisites!

### For Intermediate Learners

1. Mark completed steps you've already done
2. Focus on gaps in knowledge
3. Mix multiple resources per step
4. Use sidebar to jump between topics

### For Advanced Learners

1. Cherry-pick specific skills
2. Use as a resource directory
3. Track specialized areas
4. Return for refreshers

## üîß Customization

### Adding Resources to Steps

Edit `scripts/update-roadmap-resources.ts`:

```typescript
const resourceMappings: Record<string, string[]> = {
  "step-id": ["resource-id-1", "resource-id-2", "resource-id-3"],
};
```

Then run:

```bash
npm run update-roadmap
```

### Modifying Steps

Use MongoDB directly:

```bash
docker exec vynsera-mongodb-1 mongosh vynsera
```

```javascript
// Update a step
db.roadmaps.updateOne(
  { "steps.id": "hangul-mastery" },
  { $set: { "steps.$.estimatedTime": "1 week" } }
);
```

- Full node expansion

### Tablet (768px - 1023px)

2. **Focused Goals**: Clear objectives per step
3. **Resource Curation**: Best tools for each stage
4. **Progress Validation**: Self-assessment checkpoints
5. **Time Awareness**: Realistic time estimates
6. **Skill Building**: Cumulative knowledge gain

## üìà Progress Metrics

- ‚úÖ **Direct resource access** saves clicks
- ‚úÖ **Prerequisites prevent** wasted effort
- ‚úÖ **Better mobile UX** with sidebar
- ‚úÖ **Clearer learning path** reduces confusion
